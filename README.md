## Summary
In this study, we investigate how rapid economic growth and transition to low-carbon energy may impact hydropower development, with potential countervailing effects of increasingly cost-competitive variable renewable energy (VRE). We explore the effects of these forces on hydropower expansion in the world's 20 most eco-sensitive river basins, that have significant untapped hydropower potential and ecological richness. Our investigation is based on the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM), an integrated model of global energy-water-land dynamics. The Jupyter Notebooks provided in this repository, in combination with the GCAM outputs and other data provided in [this Zenodo repository] (link), can be used to conduct our key analysis, and reproduce the relevant results.
